# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models to address two critical objectives in loan application processing:
1. **Loan Approval Prediction**: Determine whether a loan application will be approved based on the applicant's personal and financial attributes.
2. **Default Risk Assessment**: For approved loans, predict the likelihood of default to assist financial institutions in managing risks effectively.

The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itshappy/ps4e9-original-data-loan-approval-prediction). The project explores key features like income, employment length, credit history, and loan intent to build accurate predictive models.

## Objectives
1. **Primary Objective**: Predict whether a loan will be approved (`loan_status`).
2. **Secondary Objective**: Assess the likelihood of default for approved loans.

---

## Approach
### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed the data for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Key observations:
  - Younger applicants (22â€“30 years) dominate the dataset.
  - Employment length and credit history positively correlate with loan approvals.
  - Higher loan grades (`A`, `B`) are associated with lower interest rates.
- Visualizations included distribution plots, boxplots, and a correlation heatmap.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Outlier Removal**: Used the IQR method to handle unrealistic values (e.g., ages > 100).
- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputed or removed rows with missing values for critical features.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.
  - One-hot encoded categorical features for modeling.

### 3. **Model Development**
#### Models Applied:
1. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Balanced class weights to handle imbalanced data.
   - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for selecting the top 12 features.
   - Achieved an accuracy of **80.5%** and an F1 score of **0.614**.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Tuned the `K` parameter using GridSearchCV.
   - Optimal `K = 7`, with accuracy **89.4%** and F1 score **0.696**.

3. **Neural Network (MLP)**:
   - Multi-Layer Perceptron with one hidden layer of 100 neurons.
   - Achieved accuracy **90.85%**, F1 score **0.750**, and ROC-AUC **0.892**.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Neural Network outperformed other models, demonstrating its ability to capture complex patterns.
- Logistic Regression remained interpretable and reliable for baseline predictions.
- Threshold tuning in Neural Network provided insights into balancing precision and recall for different risk tolerances.
